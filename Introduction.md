# Q-Sort

- We'll be doing a little experiment, see how our understanding changes.
- Distribution.
- There is no right or wrong. I've tried very hard for there not to be right/wrong.
- This will take some time. (2h)
- If you don't understand all the concepts, follow your gut, or rate it in the middle.
- First put them into 3 piles.
- Height of colum does not matter, 0 does not matter.
- Make notes on the back if you don't understand them, or find them stupid.
- Add your own q cards, but don't sort them in.


# Two goals
