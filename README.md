This collaborative, open-ended, as-yet-in-early-alpha-stage book (working title: `samuelson`) aims to equip citizens with the most important and most controversial issues they might encounter in their choice of taxes, specifically:

1. the base of taxation, including:
   - income (from either capital and/or labor)
   - consumption (postpaid or pre-paid aka cash-flow-based)
   - wealth (net worth, or some subset thereof)
2. the schedule of taxation, including:
   - lump-sum (or true "flat") aka. poll tax: one fixed absolute amount for all
   - proportional (often misleadingly labelled as "flat"): same percentage of (e.g.) income
   - regressive: decreasing percentage of (e.g.) income over increasing levels of income
   - progressive: increasing percentage of (e.g.) income over increasing levels of income

This is *not* so much an economics textbook on taxation (albeit some economic abstractions are highlighted), nor, generally, a source of *falsifiable*, empirical information on taxation, but a compendium of things in taxation that *reasonable* people might *disagree* on.

Following Niemeyers and Dryzeks [`Niemeyer2002`] operationalization of successful deliberative outcomes, this book attempts to map these issues along three dimensions:

1. Values (or roughly, axiology): Conceptions of the good or the normatively desirable.
2. Beliefs (or *very* roughly, ontology): Conceptions of the relevant units in the world (say, classes vs. individuals) and of their nature and motivation.
3. Preferences (in our case, taxes): Choices of the various combinations of base and schedule of taxation.

The hope inspiring this book, along with Niemeyer and Dryzek [`Niemeyer2002`] is that, underneath it all, some (meta-) *consensus* on the nature of choices and (intersubjetive) *consistency* between values, beliefs and preferences *could be found*.

Contributions to this book pursue this deliberative ideal by distilling, explaining and critiquing (supposedly) *consistent* links between values, beliefs and preferences in/on taxation and the economy.
